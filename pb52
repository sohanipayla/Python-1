52. Write a Python program to calculate the area of a  trapezoid.

a = float (input ("Enter the length of first parallel side (a): "))
b = float (input ("Enter the length of second parallel side (b): 
"))
h = float (input ("Enter the height of the trapezoid (h): "))
area = 0.5 * (a + b) * h
print ("The area of the trapezoid is:", area)
