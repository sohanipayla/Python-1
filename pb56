56. Write a python program to convert Days into Years, Months and Days. 
(Ex: if input of Days = 370 then output will be, years=1, months=0 and days = 5).

days = int (input ("Enter number of days: "))
years = days // 365
remaining_days = days % 365
months = remaining_days // 30
days_left = remaining_days % 30
print ("Years =", years)
print ("Months =", months)
print ("Days =", days_left)
